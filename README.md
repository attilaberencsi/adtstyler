# ADT Styler

A command-line tool for ABAP Development Tool (ADT) styling. Patches the Dark and Light theme of eclipse with the selected color style on Windows.

*At the moment You have one style called sapdev for the Dark theme available. Long term plans here, so more will come slowly but tested thoroughly. Expect next a Light style.*

## Motivation

3rd party themes and plugins which inject themself into Eclipse caused unstability and slowdown. Plenty of error messages appear continously in the Eclipse log view using ADT. Things were even worse working on remote environments. Good we have few of such genric plugins, but there is a point were things start to be uncomfortable and unusable. This whole little project started with adjusting a single color within a single file, due the selection highlight wasn't really spottable in the eclipse project explorer using the dark theme. After this maniac little devil ðŸ™‰  appear and wanted more. Here we are ðŸ™‹. Things can be made better looking always. There is no end in Eclipse styling, even minor issues / side-effects acceptable, right ? ðŸ˜…

## Installation

Prerequsite is [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), Windows.

```bash
npm install -g @sapdev.eu/adtstyler
```

*For the first time you might get an error that executing scripts is disabled on your computer . Please issue this command and answer Y-Yes within PowerShell started as Administrator.*

```sql
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
```

## Change Log

[Change Log](CHANGELOG.md)

## Usage

### Applying color styles

* Close all tabs, then Eclipse. *Optional: backup your eclipse folder.*
* Issue the following command in terminal:

```bash
adtstyler
```

* Select : Patch Eclipse Styles
* Enter Eclipse installation directory to be patched
* Enter a backup directory what your user has permission to write. *This folder will be used to backup the files we patch. Remember this folder, it will be needed to restore the original styles in case You do not like what You see. ðŸ‘½ ðŸ‘€*

Bad luck receiving the following, because that means the style is not supporting Your version of Eclipse.

![1740825443314](image/README/1740825443314.png)

Please look at the Styles section whether the given style suppports your eclipse version.

### Restoring your theme

In case You do not like the results, or You want to apply another style, then You need to restore the original eclipse files from your backup folder what You specified above. If You do not have the backup folder anymore for some reason, here is the [failsafe recover instruction](failsafe_recovery.md).
